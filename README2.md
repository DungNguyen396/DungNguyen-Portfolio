## 👤 👤 About Me

  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#f9f9f9">
      <p>Hi, I’m <b>Nguyen Thanh Dung</b> — a Finance & Banking specialist transitioning into the field of Data Analytics.</p>
      <p>With 7 years of experience in the banking industry, including over 2 years dedicated to financial data analysis, I possess a unique vantage point: <b>I don’t just see the numbers, I understand the business logic and strategic drivers behind them.</b></p>
      <p>Coming from a non-technical background, I view the rise of AI not as a challenge, but as a powerful equalizer. By leveraging AI to navigate technical complexities, I am able to redirect my focus toward what truly drives value: precise problem framing, rigorous assumption testing, and strategic interpretation.</p>
      <hr color="#4682B4">
      <h4>What sets a Data Analyst apart in today’s landscape?</h4>
      <p>In my view, it is the ability to think critically across domains. Deep expertise in one field is valuable, but fresh, multi-disciplinary perspectives are what often unlock the most innovative and actionable solutions. In an era of rapid innovation, this diversity of thought leads to better questions, more realistic modeling, and insights that actually move the needle for the business.</p>
      <p><i>Below are some personal projects where I apply this mindset to explore and solve real problems through the lens of data.</i></p>

## 📉 Personal Projects

### 🔵 [Project 1] Behavioral Analysis and Customer Churn Prediction
> *This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and building predictive models to understand and anticipate customer churn.*

**🔑 Key outcomes:**
* Provided a high-level view of customer churn and its overall impact.
* Identified churn as a result of behavioral sequences rather than isolated actions.
* Detected critical behavioral breakpoints associated with increased churn risk.
* Built predictive and explanatory models to support early and personalized churn intervention.
* Segmented customers based on behavioral patterns and defined behavioral thresholds for monitoring.
