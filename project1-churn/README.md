## 📌 1. OVERVIEW & CONTEXT
<div style="background-color: #e9ecef; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; border-left: 8px solid #1a3a5f;">
  <p style="color: #2c3e50; line-height: 1.6;">
    This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and building predictive models to understand and anticipate customer churn. The primary goal is to shift from reactive measures to <b>proactive retention strategies</b>.

## ❓ 2. KEY BUSINESS QUESTIONS
*How do we address these critical uncertainties?*

| No. | Question | Focus Area |
| :-- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | Is the current churn situation severe? | **Impact Assessment** |
| **02** | Is there a specific behavioral pattern leading to churn? | **Root Cause Analysis** |
| **03** | Can we predict churn early enough to intervene? | **Predictive Modeling** |
| **04** | What personalized strategies can be applied to each segment? | **Actionable Insights** |

## 🎯 3. CORE OBJECTIVES
1.  **Understand Churn Dynamics:** Evaluate the scale and impact of customer loss.
2.  **Identify Behavioral Breakpoints:** Detect the specific moments/actions where customers start disengaging.
3.  **Build Prediction Engines:** Develop models that flag "At-Risk" customers before they actually leave.
4.  **Strategic Intervention:** Design a framework for personalized retention based on behavioral clusters.

## 🏆 4. KEY OUTCOMES & FINDINGS
<div style="background-color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #dee2e6; border-radius: 12px; padding: 25px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">

### 📊 **Impact & Overview**
* Provided a high-level view of customer churn and its overall impact on the portfolio's health.
* Quantified the loss to prioritize resource allocation for retention.

### 🧠 **Behavioral Insights**
* **Sequential Logic:** Identified churn as a result of **behavioral sequences** rather than isolated, random actions.
* **Breakpoints:** Successfully detected critical behavioral breakpoints associated with a statistically significant increase in churn risk.

### 🤖 **Model Performance**
* Built predictive and explanatory models to support early and personalized churn intervention.
* Ensured the models provide "Reason Codes" to help the business understand *why* a customer is flagged.

### 📈 **Actionable Framework**
* **Segmentation:** Segmented customers based on their unique behavioral signatures.
* **Monitoring:** Defined clear behavioral thresholds for automated monitoring and alert systems.

## 🛠 5. METHODOLOGY & TOOLS
* **Data Processing:** Python (Pandas, Numpy) for cleaning and feature engineering.
* **Behavioral Tracking:** Sequence analysis and time-series feature extraction.
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Random Forest/XGBoost) for churn classification.
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib & Seaborn for mapping behavioral breakpoints.

## 💡 6. FINAL THOUGHTS
This analysis demonstrates that **churn is not an event, it's a process**. By identifying the early signals in the customer journey, we can implement intervention strategies that are not only timely but also highly relevant to the customer's specific needs.
