## 👤 About Me 

Hi, I’m **Nguyen Thanh Dung** — a Finance & Banking specialist transitioning into the field of Data Analytics.

With 7 years of experience in the banking industry, including over 2 years dedicated to financial data analysis, I possess a unique vantage point: I don't just see the numbers, I understand the business logic and strategic drivers behind them.

Coming from a non-technical background, I view the rise of AI not as a challenge, but as a powerful equalizer. By leveraging AI to navigate technical complexities, I am able to redirect my focus toward what truly drives value: precise problem framing, rigorous assumption testing, and strategic interpretation.

**What sets a Data Analyst apart in today’s landscape?**<br>
In my view, it is the ability to think critically across domains. Deep expertise in one field is valuable, but fresh, multi-disciplinary perspectives are what often unlock the most innovative and actionable solutions. In an era of rapid innovation, this diversity of thought leads to better questions, more realistic modeling, and insights that actually move the needle for the business.

Below are some personal projects where I apply this mindset to explore and solve real problems through the lens of data.<br><br><br>

### 📉 Project 1: Behavioral Analysis and Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and building predictive models to understand and anticipate customer churn.

The work addresses key business questions such as the severity of churn, the behavioral patterns leading to churn, the feasibility of early churn prediction, and the potential for personalized intervention strategies.

**🔑 Key outcomes:**
- Provided a high-level view of customer churn and its overall impact
- Identified churn as a result of behavioral sequences rather than isolated actions
- Detected critical behavioral breakpoints associated with increased churn risk
- Built predictive and explanatory models to support early and personalized churn intervention
- Segmented customers based on behavioral patterns and defined behavioral thresholds for monitoring

### 📉 Project 2: Card Portfolio Value and Sustainability Analysis
This project focuses on identifying the source of value and assessing the sustainability of the card portfolio based on the relationship between spending behavior and customer financial health.

[→ 🔎 Analysis Detail](project2-card)

**🔑 Key Outcomes:**
- Core Value Positioning: Identifying the Middle Income group and essential goods/services (Bills, Shopping) as the most stable revenue pillars.
- Demonstrating Sustainability: Confirming low risk levels with a safe DTI (Debit/Credit Interchange Rate) (2.3 - 2.6) and the ability to maintain good cash liquidity for customers.
- Decoding Payment Behavior: Discovering a preference for using debit cards for essential needs, demonstrating financial discipline even among those with high debt levels.
- Identifying spending shifts: Note the portfolio's adaptation as cash flow shifts towards defensive sectors (Healthcare) to preserve overall sales.
- Proposing safe growth: Focus on shifting spending behavior from Debit to Credit in high-income segments and low-risk industries.

### 📉 Project 3: Automated Approval Workflow for Digital Advertising Campaigns
This project focuses on building an automated decision engine to optimize the balance between risk and profitability using calibrated machine learning models.

[→ 🔎 Analysis Detail](project3-digital)

**🔑 Key Outcomes:**

- Risk-Adjusted Decisioning: Implementing an optimal probability threshold (0.88) to maximize expected net profit while retaining high-growth "mutation gain" campaigns.

- Three-Tier Operational Strategy:

   - AUTO-PASS: Seamlessly approving the safe segment (>92% of volume), significantly reducing manual intervention and operational overhead.

   - MANUAL REVIEW: Isolating borderline cases with high actual risk for expert evaluation to prevent potential revenue leakage.

   - AUTO-REJECT: Instantly blocking campaigns with failure probabilities exceeding the safety limit to protect profit margins.

- Predictive Transparency: Providing granular "Loss Drivers" for every decision, enabling the operations team to understand the specific risk factors behind each flagged campaign.

- Model Reliability & Calibration: Achieving high probabilistic accuracy (Brier Score: 0.11), ensuring that automated actions are based on stable, real-world data rather than aggressive bias.
