## <p align="left" style="color:#4682B4;">👤 About Me</p>
<table border="0" style="width:100%;">
  <tr>
    <td width="75%" style="vertical-align:top;">
      <p>Hi, I’m <b>Nguyen Thanh Dung</b> — a Finance & Banking specialist transitioning into the field of Data Analytics.</p>
      <p>With 7 years of experience in the banking industry, including over 2 years dedicated to financial data analysis, I possess a unique vantage point: <b>I don’t just see the numbers, I understand the business logic and strategic drivers behind them.</b></p>
      <p>Coming from a non-technical background, I view the rise of AI not as a challenge, but as a powerful equalizer. By leveraging AI to navigate technical complexities, I am able to redirect my focus toward what truly drives value: precise problem framing, rigorous assumption testing, and strategic interpretation.</p>
      <p><b>What sets a Data Analyst apart in today’s landscape?</b><br>
      In my view, it is the ability to think critically across domains. Deep expertise in one field is valuable, but fresh, multi-disciplinary perspectives are what often unlock the most innovative and actionable solutions. In an era of rapid innovation, this diversity of thought leads to better questions, more realistic modeling, and insights that actually move the needle for the business.</p>
