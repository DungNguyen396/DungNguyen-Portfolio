## 👤 About Me 

Hi, I’m **Nguyen Thanh Dung** — a finance and banking professional with a strong focus on data analysis.

I have 7 years of experience in finance and banking, including over 2 years in data analysis within the financial sector. My background allows me to understand not only the data itself, but also the business logic and constraints behind it.

Although I don’t come from a traditional technical background, stepping into the role of a data analyst was not as difficult as it might seem. With a strong learning mindset and the support of AI tools, technical barriers are significantly reduced which allowing more focus on problem framing, assumptions, and interpretation.

So what truly makes the difference?  
It’s not just technical skills, but **the ability to think critically and view problems from multiple perspectives**. Being highly skilled in one domain doesn’t guarantee exclusivity; fresh viewpoints from other fields can often lead to equally strong or even better solutions.

In an era of rapid innovation, multiple perspectives often lead to better questions, more realistic assumptions and more actionable insights, especially in data analytics.

Below are some personal projects where I apply this mindset to explore and solve problems across different domains using data.<br><br><br>
