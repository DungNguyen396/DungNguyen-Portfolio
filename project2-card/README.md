## 🗒️ Project 2: Card Portfolio Value and Sustainability Analysis
**Project Background:** This analysis was requested by the Card Strategy team to evaluate the performance and sustainability of a newly launched dual-card product line. The goal was to audit the existing customer base to verify if the product is attracting the intended target segments and meeting strategic expectations. By examining the relationship between spending behavior and financial health, the project provides a factual basis for either scaling the current model or implementing product refinements. Ultimately, these insights ensure that the card portfolio remains a low-risk, high-value asset that aligns with the bank's long-term growth objectives.

### ❓ Business Questions
This project evaluates the core value and long-term viability of the card portfolio:

**1. Value Origin**

Which income segments and merchant categories form the backbone of the portfolio's revenue?

**2. Financial Sustainability**

Given the current Debt-to-Income (DTI) levels, is the portfolio at risk of liquidity issues, or is the debt backed by sustainable repayment capacity?

**3. Liquidity & Spending Discipline**

What does the preference for Debit transactions among high-debt users reveal about the portfolio's cash flow health?

**4. Portfolio Adaptability**

How effectively does the portfolio rebalance through "defensive" sectors (e.g., Healthcare) when discretionary spending declines?

**5. Strategic Growth**

How can we stimulate growth without breaching the portfolio's established safety margins?<br><br>

### 🔑 Key Findings & Outcomes
**1. Core Value from Essential Utilities**

Quantitative analysis identifies Medium Income users and Bills/Shopping categories as the primary revenue pillars, ensuring stable and non-volatile cash flows.

**3. Proven Sustainability via DTI Metrics**

Established a safe average DTI range ($2.3 - 2.6$), confirming that existing debt does not impede short-term spending capacity and the portfolio maintains a low risk-lag.

**4. Discovery of "Cash-First" Discipline**

A pivotal finding shows high-debt segments consistently prioritize Debit for essentials. This indicates robust cash liquidity and disciplined financial management within the user base.

**5. Identification of Defensive Spending Shifts**

Recorded a strategic migration of capital toward Healthcare (+2.11%) as other sectors plateaued, proving the portfolio's high resilience to market fluctuations.

**6. Framework for Low-Risk Growth**

Proposed a behavioral shift from Debit to Credit within low-risk categories, aiming to increase ARPU without escalating systemic risk levels.<br><br>
