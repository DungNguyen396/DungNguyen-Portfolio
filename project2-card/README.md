🗒️ Project 2: Card Portfolio Value and Sustainability Analysis
❓ Business Questions
This project evaluates the core value and long-term viability of the card portfolio:
Value Origin: Which income segments and merchant categories form the backbone of the portfolio's revenue?
Financial Sustainability: Given the current Debt-to-Income (DTI) levels, is the portfolio at risk of liquidity issues, or is the debt backed by sustainable repayment capacity?
Liquidity & Spending Discipline: What does the preference for Debit transactions among high-debt users reveal about the portfolio's cash flow health?
Portfolio Adaptability: How effectively does the portfolio rebalance through "defensive" sectors (e.g., Healthcare) when discretionary spending declines?
Strategic Growth: How can we stimulate growth without breaching the portfolio's established safety margins?
🔑 Key Findings & Outcomes
Core Value from Essential UtilitiesQuantitative analysis identifies Medium Income users and Bills/Shopping categories as the primary revenue pillars, ensuring stable and non-volatile cash flows.
Proven Sustainability via DTI MetricsEstablished a safe average DTI range ($2.3 - 2.6$), confirming that existing debt does not impede short-term spending capacity and the portfolio maintains a low risk-lag.
Discovery of "Cash-First" DisciplineA pivotal finding shows high-debt segments consistently prioritize Debit for essentials. This indicates robust cash liquidity and disciplined financial management within the user base.
Identification of Defensive Spending ShiftsRecorded a strategic migration of capital toward Healthcare (+2.11%) as other sectors plateaued, proving the portfolio's high resilience to market fluctuations.
Framework for Low-Risk GrowthProposed a behavioral shift from Debit to Credit within low-risk categories, aiming to increase ARPU without escalating systemic risk levels.📂 Analysis DocumentsEDA, Portfolio Health Check & DTI SegmentationBehavioral Analysis: Debit vs Credit across Income SegmentsYear-over-Year Trend Analysis & Strategic Recommendations
