  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Nguyen Thanh Dung</strong>.</p>

  <p>I have 7 years of experience in finance and banking, including over 2 years specializing in data analysis within the financial sector.</p>

  <p>Although I don’t come from a traditional technical background, stepping into the role of a data analyst was not as difficult as it might seem. With a strong learning mindset and the support of AI tools, implementing analytical techniques is no longer a major barrier.</p>

  <p>So what truly makes the difference? It’s not just technical skills, but the ability to think critically and view problems from multiple perspectives. Being highly skilled in one domain doesn’t guarantee exclusivity; fresh viewpoints from other fields can often lead to equally strong or even better solutions.</p>

  <p>In an era of rapid innovation, multiple perspectives often lead to better questions, more realistic assumptions, and more actionable insights — especially in data analytics.</p>

  <h2>📉 Project 1: Behavioral Analysis and Customer Churn Prediction</h2>

  <p><a href="project1-churn/">→ From data to decision</a></p>

  <p>This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and building predictive models to understand and anticipate customer churn.</p>

  <p>The work addresses key business questions such as the severity of churn, the behavioral patterns leading to churn, the feasibility of early churn prediction, and the potential for personalized intervention strategies.</p>

  <h3>Key outcomes:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Provided a high-level view of customer churn and its overall impact</li>
    <li>Identified churn as a result of behavioral sequences rather than isolated actions</li>
    <li>Detected critical behavioral breakpoints associated with increased churn risk</li>
    <li>Built predictive and explanatory models to support early and personalized churn intervention</li>
    <li>Segmented customers based on behavioral patterns and defined behavioral thresholds for monitoring</li>
  </ul>
