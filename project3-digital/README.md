📉 Project 3: Automated Approval Workflow for Digital Advertising Campaigns
This project focuses on building an automated decision engine to optimize the balance between risk and profitability using calibrated machine learning models.

➔ Analysis Detail

🔑 Key Outcomes:

Risk-Adjusted Decisioning: Implementing an optimal probability threshold (0.88) to maximize expected net profit while retaining high-growth "mutation gain" campaigns.

Three-Tier Operational Strategy:

AUTO-PASS: Seamlessly approving the safe segment (>92% of volume), significantly reducing manual intervention and operational overhead.

MANUAL REVIEW: Isolating borderline cases with high actual risk for expert evaluation to prevent potential revenue leakage.

AUTO-REJECT: Instantly blocking campaigns with failure probabilities exceeding the safety limit to protect profit margins.

Predictive Transparency: Providing granular "Loss Drivers" for every decision, enabling the operations team to understand the specific risk factors behind each flagged campaign.

Model Reliability & Calibration: Achieving high probabilistic accuracy (Brier Score: 0.11), ensuring that automated actions are based on stable, real-world data rather than aggressive bias.
