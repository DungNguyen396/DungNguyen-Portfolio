📉 Project 3: Automated Approval Workflow for Digital Advertising Campaigns<br>
Project Background: This project developed an ML-driven system to automate the manual advertising approval process. The objective was to establish an optimal probability threshold to filter out high-risk losses while retaining high-potential growth campaigns. The system scales operational capacity and ensures financial safety through real-time, data-driven decisioning.

❓ Business Questions
1. Profit Optimization: What is the optimal probability threshold that balances risk mitigation with maximum profit retention?
2. Reliability: How accurately does the model’s predicted loss probability (Brier Score) align with actual historical outcomes?
3. Efficiency: What percentage of the portfolio can be safely transitioned to an "Auto-Pass" state?
4. Transparency: Which specific variables (Loss Drivers) are primarily responsible for a campaign being flagged or rejected?

🔑 Key Findings & Outcomes
Optimal Threshold (0.88): Identified the precise cutoff point to protect net profit margins without sacrificing growth opportunities.

High-Fidelity Calibration: Achieved a Brier Score of 0.11, confirming that the model’s risk assessments are highly reliable for live operations.

92% Automation Rate: Successfully transitioned the majority of the workflow to automated approval, maintaining an actual loss rate (14.9%) lower than the expected baseline (15.7%).

Risk Isolation: The "Manual Review" tier accurately isolated high-risk segments, where the actual loss rate reached 80%.

Loss Driver Framework: Automated the extraction of the top 3 risk factors for every prediction, providing full transparency for the operations team.

Measurable Profit Lift: Generated a net profit increase (+$15,239) by recovering profitable campaigns previously misclassified by rigid manual rules.
